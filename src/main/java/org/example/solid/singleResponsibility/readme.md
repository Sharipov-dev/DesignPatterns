Single responsibility means that each class must have only one responsibility. 
It is neeeded in order not to be afraid of making changes inside the class, so you won't affect other classes. 
Another benefit is that this class is easier to test. 
In the example I have two classes, first one is responsible for making changes for users, another one for admins.
Both of them are independent from each other.
